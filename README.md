🖌️ Product Design Tools in Magento 2

Product Design Tools in Magento 2 allow customers to personalize products directly on the store’s frontend before purchase. These tools are ideal for stores selling customizable items such as t-shirts, mugs, phone cases, business cards, or jewelry.

They empower users to design their own products by adding images, text, colors, cliparts, and more — resulting in a more engaging and interactive shopping experience.
